# Smart Irrigation System – Features & Configuration

This document provides a **technical overview** of key features, configuration files, and data management mechanisms of the Smart Irrigation System.  
It complements the main [README.md](../../README.md) by offering an in-depth look into how the system works and how to customize it.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Multi-Zone Irrigation Control
Each **edge node** (typically a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W) manages one or more irrigation zones — each zone corresponding to a relay output that controls a valve.

**Capabilities:**
- Independent settings and weather sensitivity per zone
    - This allows for tailored irrigation strategies based on plant type and location.
    - **Example 1**: *A vegetable garden zone may require more frequent watering than a lawn zone*
    - **Example 2**: *A shaded flower is less affected by solar radiation changes than a sun-exposed area*
- Sequential or parallel operation (configurable globally)
- Adjustable flow balancing to prevent system low pressure (which would affect irrigation precision)


---

### 2. Weather-Based Irrigation
The system dynamically adjusts watering based on:

**Recent weather data:**
- Real-time weather data is fetched via a weather API (e.g., Ecowitt station).
- Each node computes required water volume using **global correction factors** & **per-zone correction factors** derived from weather conditions.
- Maximum and minimum thresholds can be defined to avoid over- or under-watering.
- If the node is offline or the weather API is unreachable, the system falls back to default irrigation amounts.
- For testing purposes, a built-in **WeatherSimulator** can generate synthetic weather data.
- Current version (v0.9) supports three weather parameters: *temperature*, *solar radiation*, and *rainfall*. Future versions may include additional parameters.

**Weather forecast:**
- In future releases, forecast data will be integrated to further optimize irrigation scheduling.

**Irrigation calculation model:**
- The current model calculates the required water volume dynamically based on deviations from *standard weather conditions*. The calculation model uses the following logic:
1. **Base target water amount**:
    - Each irrigation node calculates `base_target_water_amount` from the configured `target_mm` (even-area-mode) or `liters_per_minimum_dripper` (dripper-mode). This represend the default water volume needed under standard weather conditions.
2. **Weather condition deltas**:
    - The system computes the difference (delta) between the current weather conditions and predefined standard conditions (delta solar radiation, delta temperature, delta rainfall).
3. **Correction factors**:
    - The system first applies global correction factors (defined in `config_global.json`) to the base target water amount based on the weather deltas.
    - Next, it applies per-zone correction factors (defined in `zones_config.json`) to further adjust the water amount for each specific zone.
4. **Total adjusted water amount**:
    - The final adjusted water amount for each zone is calculated by combining the base target water amount with the effects of both global and per-zone correction factors.

- This model allows for a nuanced and responsive irrigation strategy that adapts to real-time environmental conditions, ensuring optimal water usage.

> The weather-based irrigation logic is modular and can be extended in future versions to include additional parameters.

> The current weather model can be replaced in future releases with more advanced models, including machine learning-based predictions and self-correcting algorithms if feedback data (e.g., soil moisture sensors) is integrated.

### 3. Irrigation Logic & Scheduling
- **Automatic daily irrigation:** runs once per day at configurable time.
- **Manual irrigation:** per-zone manual start with water amount can be triggered remotely in Web UI or locally via CLI.
- **Mixed irrigation:** automatic irrigation can run concurrently with manual tasks if conditions allow.
- **Flow monitoring:** automatically distributes irrigation when simultaneous zones would exceed the max flow rate.

**Irrigation modes:**
- **Sequential mode:** zones irrigate one after another based on order in configuration.
- **Concurrent mode:** multiple zones irrigate concurrently.
- **Hybrid mode:** if *flow monitoring* is enabled, zones irrigate concurrently up to the max flow rate; remaining zones wait in a queue. **This mode ensures that the water pressure won't drop below acceptable levels** which would affect irrigation accuracy.

**Controller states:**
| State | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `IDLE` | System ready, no irrigation in progress |
| `IRRIGATING` | One or more zones actively irrigating |
| `STOPPING` | Irrigation stopping in progress |
| `ERROR` | System failure, all valves closed for safety |

**Zone states:**
| State | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `IDLE` | Zone ready, not irrigating |
| `IRRIGATING` | Zone actively irrigating |
| `WAITING` | Zone queued for irrigation (concurrent mode) |
| `ERROR` | Zone failure, valve closed for safety |
---

### 4. Safety & Reliability
- **Fail-safe valves:** all valves are normally closed (`NC` type). On crash or power loss → system defaults to closed valves.
- **Thread isolation:** each irrigation zone runs in its own thread.
- **State persistence:** zone states (`zones_state.json`) are saved and restored after restart.
- **Unclean shutdown recovery:** interrupted irrigation sessions are logged and marked as “interrupted”.
- **Error detection:** system monitors for common errors (e.g., weather API failure) and logs them.
- *Watchdog thread and health checks planned for future releases.*
- *Heartbeat mechanism between nodes and server planned for future releases.*

---

### 5. Data Logging & Monitoring
- Local node logs all events in `/runtime/node/logs/` (`system_log.log`).
- Irrigation runs are recorded in `irrigation_log.json` (time, duration, water volume, weather conditions). All irrigation attempts are logged, including interrupted or failed sessions.
- Server aggregates node state and provides summary via `/api/nodes`.
- Web UI displays live node state, last update time.
- *Central log aggregation planned for future releases.*

**Log levels:** `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL` (level configurable in `config_global.json`).

## Configuration Files

All configuration and runtime data is stored as JSON files, located in the `runtime/` directory.  
Each node and server has its own configuration space.

### Node Configuration Files

> In stable releases, configuration files will be handled by the server and pushed to nodes remotely.

#### `config_global.json`
Defines global system behavior and environmental parameters.

**1. Definition of standard weather conditions:**
Reference values for weather parameters under which base irrigation amounts are considered optimal.

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `solar_total` | `6.5` | Total solar radiation (kWh/m²/day) |
| `temperature_celsius` | `17.0` | Average temperature since last irrigation (°C) |
| `rainfall_mm` | `0.0` | Standard daily rainfall (mm) |

**2. Correction factors for weather adjustments:**
Coefficients that determine how deviations from standard conditions affect irrigation amounts.
- Positive values indicate **direct proportionality** (more = more irrigation).
- Negative values indicate **inverse proportionality** (more = less irrigation).

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `solar` | `0.05` | % change per kWh/m² deviation |
| `rain` | `-0.15` | % change per mm deviation |
| `temperature` | `0.1` | % change per °C deviation |

*Example:* A `rain` factor of `-0.15` means that for every additional mm of rainfall above the standard, the irrigation amount is reduced by 15%.

### Server Configuration Files

*Currently, the server does not have dedicated configuration files. All settings are hardcoded for prototype purposes. In future versions, a `server_config.json` file will be introduced to manage server settings such as MQTT broker details, REST API settings, and node management parameters.*

### 6. Communication & Networking
The system uses:
- **MQTT** for Node ↔ Server communication
- **REST API** for UI ↔ Server integration.

#### MQTT Topics

> *Note: <node_id> is string identifier of the node, e.g., `node1`*

| Direction | Topic | Payload | Notes |
|------------|--------|----------|------|
| Node → Server | `irrigation/<node_id>/status` | JSON with controller state, zones, auto/paused flags | |
| Server → Node | `irrigation/<node_id>/start_irrigation` | JSON with zone_id and volume (liters) | Triggers manual irrigation on specified zone |
| Server → Node | `irrigation/<node_id>/stop_irrigation` | Empty | Stops all irrigation on the node |
