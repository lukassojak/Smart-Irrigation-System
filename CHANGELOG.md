## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed
- `WeatherSimulator` is now not used in production, nor as a fallback for `RecentWeatherFetcher` in development mode. It is only used when explicitly invoked by disabling use of API in development mode.

### Fixed
- RecentWeatherFetcher now handles invalid API secrets gracefully, uses default values (standard weather conditions) when secrets are invalid as a fallback.

### Removed
