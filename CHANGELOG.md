## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Documentation for `IrrigationController` state machine in `docs/CONTROLLER_STATE_MACHINE.md`.

### Changed
- Improved `CircuitStateManager` to handle concurrent access to state files using file locking mechanism, preventing data corruption.

### Fixed
- Fixed minor bugs in `CircuitStateManager`.

### Removed

### Known Issues
- `IrrigationCLI` throws an exception during irrigation (no more details known yet) - investigation ongoing. Exception in the CLI does not affect the main irrigation process.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- `use_weathersimulator` attribute in `config_global.json` to allow switching between `RecentWeatherFetcher` and `WeatherSimulator` for global conditions. If `environment` is set to `production`, this setting is ignored and `RecentWeatherFetcher` is always used.
- Automatic logging of interrupted irrigation results during system startup after unclean shutdowns.
  - If a circuit was irrigating during an unexpected shutdown, it is now automatically marked as `interrupted` in `zones_state.json`.
  - An `IrrigationResult` entry is now appended to `irrigation_log.json` for full historical consistency.

### Changed
- Automatic irrigation now does not require `ControllerState` to be `IDLE`. This allows automatic irrigation to run even if manual irrigation is in progress.
- Improved unclean shutdown detection in `CircuitStateManager.init_circuit_states()` to recover interrupted irrigation sessions and maintain data consistency between state and log files.

### Fixed
- `CircuitStateManager` now updates `last_update` timestamp when state is changed to `shutdown`.
- Fixed inconsistency in `zones_state.json` and `irrigation_log.json` when system was terminated unexpectedly during irrigation.
- `WeatherSimulator` now provides same interface as `RecentWeatherFetcher` for better compatibility.
- Fixed `IrrigationController` state management when both automatic and manual irrigation run concurrently.
- `CircuitStateManager` now correctly updates `last_update` timestamp when irrigation is stopped.
- `IrrigationController` now correctly handles attempts to manually irrigate a zone which is already irrigating.
- `ControllerState` management significantly improved to accurately reflect ongoing irrigation activities, even when both automatic and manual irrigation processes are running concurrently. The controller state now correctly indicates active irrigation, preventing premature transitions to `IDLE` and ensuring that `stop_irrigation()` functions as intended for all ongoing processes.

### Removed

### Known Issues
- Main loop allows multiple irrigation attempts in irrigation time window if the previous attempt was skipped due to weather conditions. 
- `IrrigationCLI` throws an exception during irrigation (no more details known yet) - investigation ongoing. Exception in the CLI does not affect the main irrigation process.

---

## [0.4.2] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- Weather data cache is now refreshed periodically in main loop based on a interval defined in `IrrigationController`.
- Log rotation added for `system_log.log` to prevent excessive file size growth. Default settings: daily rotation, keep 30 backup files. The logs are located in the `/logs/` directory
- Example data files: `data/zones_state.example.json` and `data/irrigation_log.example.json` added

### Changed
- `RecentWeatherFetcher` now does not save all fetched data to a file (was implemented for debugging purposes only).

### Fixed
- `IrrigationCLI` now handles errors gracefully and continues running instead of crashing on exceptions.
- Fixed duplicated cleanups in `IrrigationController`.

### Removed

### Known Issues
- Type error is occurring when trying to manually irrigate a zone which is already irrigating.
- When irrigation is stopped, `CircuitStateManager` does not update the `last_update` timestamp, leading to inaccurate state tracking.
- If `global_conditions_provider` in `IrrigationController` is set to `WeatherSimulator`, some methods are not available in the simulator, leading to potential crashes.
- `CircuitStateManager` does not update `last_update` timestamp when state is changed to `shutdown`.
- Main loop allows multiple irrigation attempts in irrigation time window if the previous attempt was skipped due to weather conditions. 
- `irrigation_log.json` is not updated correctly.
- `IrrigationCLI` throws an exception during irrigation (no more details known yet) - investigation ongoing. Exception in the CLI does not affect the main irrigation process.

- `RecentWeatherFetcher` now handles no internet connectivity gracefully, preventing unhandled exceptions.
- `IrrigationCircuit` correctly updates its runtime state attribute after skipping irrigation due to weather conditions.

### Removed
- `ConsoleLogHandler` removed as it is no longer needed with the CLI.

### Known Issues
- The `CircuitStateManager` does not handle race conditions when multiple threads access the state file simultaneously. This may lead to data corruption or loss of state information. A locking mechanism will be implemented in a future release to address this issue.
- Manual irrigation from the CLI does not support stopping an ongoing irrigation process. This will be added in a future release.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-08-28

### Added
- Enhanced CLI with new features for better user experience and system monitoring.
- Circuit 'DISABLED' state support in CLI and core logic.

### Changed

### Fixed
- WeatherSimulator initialization fixed.
- Resolved potential endless loop in `IrrigationController` occuring after first automatic irrigation run.
- Updated logic to skip next irrigation check (AUTO paused)

### Removed

### Known Issues
- On CTRL+C, the CLI does not exit gracefully and when irrigation is running, it may not stop.
- The `config_global.json` does not contain a `api_enabled` flag, which is required for the `RecentWeatherFetcher` to function correctly. This will be added in the future release.
- `max_flow_monitoring` feature does not work correctly at the moment. This will be addressed in a future release.
- Auto pause does not work correctly.
- No internet connectivity leads to unhandled exceptions in `RecentWeatherFetcher`.
- The `CircuitStateManager` does not handle empty data files correctly, leading to potential crashes.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-17
*First hardware-ready release. Added GPIO support and first deployment on Raspberry Pi Zero W for real-world testing.*

### Added
- Command-line interface (CLI) for interactive control of the irrigation system.
    - Non-blocking execution for long-running irrigation processes
    - Provides an interface for testing and monitoring the system over SSH
- Example log outputs for different scenarios in /examples/log_samples/ directory.
- Updated `README.md` with logging examples.
- GPIO support for `RelayValve` class to control irrigation circuits using GPIO pins with fallback to simulated GPIO for testing.

### Changed
- `WeatherSimulator` is now not used in production, nor as a fallback for `RecentWeatherFetcher` in development mode. It is only used when explicitly invoked by disabling use of API in development mode.
- `RecentWeatherFetcher` now uses dictionary for caching weather data, improving performance and simplifying data retrieval.
- Updated `config_global.json` and `zones_config.json` to include `solar_total` and `solar` fields for better solar radiation tracking for irrigation decisions.
- Updated relevant documentation to reflect changes in configuration files and their usage.
- Solar radiation data is now used in the `IrrigationCircuit` for more accurate irrigation decisions based on solar exposure (instead of sunlight hours placeholder).

### Fixed
- RecentWeatherFetcher now handles invalid API secrets gracefully, uses default values (standard weather conditions) when secrets are invalid as a fallback.

### Removed
- Threading support validation in `IrrigationController` as the threading is crucial for the system's operation and should not be disabled.

### Known Issues
- The `config_global.json` does not contain a `api_enabled` flag, which is required for the `RecentWeatherFetcher` to function correctly. This will be added in the next release.
